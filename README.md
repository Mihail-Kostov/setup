# MoOx `setup`

> Dotfiles, aliases, functions, preferences, apps. Everything.

### First run

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoOx/setupsh/master/firstrun | zsh -s MoOx/setup
```

The first run can easily take half of a day, with some human interactions to configure some part.

### Update & run

```console
$ fliptable
```
